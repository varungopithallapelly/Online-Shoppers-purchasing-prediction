It is observed from the table that the means are much closer to the minimum values of the attributes than to the maximums, which tells that the distributions are not normal.
Highs are well outside the 3rd quartile on many variables which tells that there will be outliers.
we also have negative value at least in several variables related to time, which apparently doesn't make any sense. This is explained properly through graphs.

```{r}
#two-way table for summary statistics
